# SQL-Challenge-4-Danny-Data-Bank

This is the forth challenge by Danny Ma, named as Data Bank case study, which is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

1) regions
2) customers nodes
3) customer transactions
